# VSCode extensions and settings + other tools

That was me when I attempted to set up my VSCode environment for Python development for the first time. Check the boxes where you can relate:

- [ ] PyCharm is great but I miss VSCode lightness and customizability. Let's try to configure it.
- [ ] I have just configured VSCode for Python development but intellisense/autocomplete/suggestions are not working as expected.
- [ ] I have watched a lot of YouTube videos and read a lot of articles but it's still not working. I'm missing PyCharm...

If you can relate to any of the above, you are in the right place. I have been there and I have found a solution that works for me. I hope it works for you too.
